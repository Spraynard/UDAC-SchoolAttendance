# UDAC-SchoolAttendance
This is a repository holding the work I have done refactoring the school attendance project from Udacity's Javascript Design Patterns Course

The big takeaway on this repository is that the files with "n" in front of them (for example; 'nindex' & 'napp') are the 'newer' versions. Meaning these are the versions that contain my code that was used to refactor the project.
